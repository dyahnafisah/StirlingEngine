# Stirling Engine
Data analysis including data cleaning, graph plotting, and calculation of the result of the Stirling Engine experiment.

A Stirling engine is a heat engine that is operated by the cyclic compression and expansion of air or other gas (the working fluid) at different temperatures, resulting in a net conversion of heat energy to mechanical work. More specifically, the Stirling engine is a closed-cycle regenerative heat engine with a permanent gaseous working fluid. In this experiment, Stirling engine beta type was used.
